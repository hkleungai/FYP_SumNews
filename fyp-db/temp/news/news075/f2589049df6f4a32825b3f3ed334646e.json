{"title": "Donald Trump set to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to supreme court – live", "text": "13:44\n\nDonald Trump’s expected nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court, to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is drawing attention to a secretive Catholic “covenant community” called People of Praise that counts Barrett as a member and faces claims of adhering to a “highly authoritarian” structure.\n\nThe 48-year-old appellate court judge has said she is a “faithful Catholic” but that her religious beliefs would not “bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge”.\n\nAt the same time, the Louisiana native and Notre Dame Law graduate, a favorite among Trump’s evangelical Christian base, has said legal careers ought not to be seen as means of gaining satisfaction, prestige or money, but rather “as a means to the end of serving God”.\n\nInterviews with experts who have studied charismatic Christian groups such as People of Praise, and with former members of the group, plus a review of the group’s own literature, reveal an organization that appears to dominate some members’ everyday lives, in which so-called “heads” – or spiritual advisers – make big life decisions, and in which members are expected to financially support one another.\n\nMarried women – such as Barrett – count their husbands as their “heads” and all members are expected to donate 5% of their income to the organization.\n\nFull story:", "date_added": "2020-09-26 00:00:00+00:00", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/sep/26/donald-trump-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-ruth-bader-ginsburg-live-news", "source": "the Guardian", "photos_url": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e703ff3223fec8660ff9ced092cbea2798f5629/1_0_5468_3281/master/5468.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7088e41dfe1c886333983ecd5ba9e69", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/316ecaf24814dc184ffbe57ef3baefa7416b60af/0_0_3515_2110/master/3515.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0cbc4f6cb27be2e0a4e583177e7f83a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&gdpr=0&comscorekw=Donald+Trump%2CUS+politics%2CUS+news%2CUS+supreme+court%2CUS+constitution+and+civil+liberties%2CLaw+%28US%29%2CTrump+administration%2CUS+Senate%2CUS+Congress%2CUS+elections+2020%2CRepublicans%2CDemocrats%2CWorld+news%2CLaw", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/463460171768f1a03cb4d6fbc8db8956/us-elections-2020.svg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/316ecaf24814dc184ffbe57ef3baefa7416b60af/0_0_3515_2110/master/3515.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7428e5b320b219181058f8bd9dde4ff", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
