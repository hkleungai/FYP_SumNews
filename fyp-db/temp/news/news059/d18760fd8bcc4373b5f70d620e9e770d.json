The penalty of 5yrs in jail for unauthorized assembly and 1yr for wearing a mask, I‚Äôm not deterred whenever I think of fellow protestors who are struggling in detention in HK or in Mainland China. ‚Äî Joshua Wong ÈªÉ‰πãÈãí üò∑ (@joshuawongcf) September 24, 2020\n\nJonathan Man, Wong‚Äôs lawyer, told AFP news agency that the pro-democracy activist was ‚Äúaccused of participating in an unlawful assembly on October 5 last year, when hundreds marched to oppose an anti-mask ban the government rolled out‚Äù.\n\nThe anti-mask law was introduced last year in a bid to help police identify protesters they suspected of committing crimes and it is facing a challenge in court. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government has made face masks mandatory in most circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWong said on Twitter that he faced five years in jail and one additional year for a mask. The case will begin on September 30, he added.\n\nHong Kong police confirmed they arrested two men, aged 23 and 74, on Thursday for illegal assembly on October 5, 2019.\n\nAmnesty International identified the second man as Koo Sze-yiu in a statement condemning the arrests.\n\nWong‚Äôs arrest ‚Äúfor wearing a face mask at an ‚Äòunauthorised protest ‚Äì at a time when wearing a face mask is compulsory in the city ‚Äì is yet another example of the government‚Äôs campaign to silence dissent by any means,‚Äù said Lam Cho Ming, Amnesty‚Äôs Hong Kong Programme Manager.\n\n‚ÄúThe mask ban violates international law and must be withdrawn, rather than used by the Hong Kong authorities as a pretext for arresting opponents,‚Äù Ming added.\n\nWong‚Äôs arrest comes about six weeks after media tycoon Jimmy Lai was detained on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces.\n\nWong had been a frequent visitor to Washington, DC, where he appealed to the United States Congress to support Hong Kong‚Äôs democracy movement and counter Beijing‚Äôs tightening grip over the global financial hub. His visits drew the wrath of Beijing, which describes him as a ‚Äúblack hand‚Äù of foreign forces.\n\nWong disbanded his pro-democracy group Demosisto in June, just hours after China‚Äôs parliament passed a national security law for Hong Kong, bypassing the city‚Äôs local legislature, a move widely criticised by Western governments.\n\nHis long-time colleague, Agnes Chow, and two other activists were also among 10 people arrested in August on suspicion of violating the new law.\n\nThe new law punishes anything China considers as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison.\n\nWong was just 17 years old when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement democracy protests, but he was not a leading figure of the sometimes violent unrest that shook the semi-autonomous former British colony last year.", "date_added": "2020-09-24 00:00:00+00:00", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/24/hong-kongs-joshua-wong-arrested-for-2019-illegal-assembly", "source": "", "photos_url": ["https://www.aljazeera.com/static/media/footer-icon--white.9c8198f5.svg", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bb5b4de7de41467aa8159745393a10f5_18.jpeg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eiqw_wxXkAAOz47.jpeg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/000_8QH6ZN-1.jpg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/000_8QL872.jpg?resize=770%2C513", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a27600140a3d403bbd31d073f63a08fa_18.jpeg?resize=270%2C180", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AP_20211287643615.jpg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8050b5b2ce58466c9913fbb868c5f38c_18.jpeg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bc4034e54e814705b6b783530b1c5a6f_18.jpeg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3f30ad7c74a547eea026f3de8c781399_8.jpeg?resize=270%2C180", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/000_8PY4FU.jpg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/70ab454aac024a3ca4910b47128fce74_18.jpeg?resize=270%2C180", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/09f2ab0e19bc4dc8b0ae2ace0f59b19c_18.jpeg?resize=170%2C113", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/000_8QL872.jpg?resize=1200%2C630"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
