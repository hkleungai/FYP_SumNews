But the fact is that there are very few criminal guns in circulation - and the culture of policing has never seen it as acceptable to be universally armed.\n\nHowever, Tasers are increasingly a common sight in the UK - and a massive survey of police officers recently found three-quarters would carry one of the less-than-lethal devices on the frontline, if given the choice.\n\nYogarajah Emmanuel, 43, who runs a shop opposite the custody suite, said he woke up at 02:30 BST to the sound of sirens.\n\n\"I looked out of my window and could see three ambulances,\" said Mr Emmanuel.\n\nImage caption Yogarajah Emmanuel, who runs a shop opposite the custody suite, said he saw an ambulance speed away at 02:30 on Friday\n\n\"There was noise and all of a sudden one ambulance from inside the car park came out and sped off.\n\n\"This morning I heard it was a police officer and just felt so sad. They are all very good people and wave and say hello when they come to my shop.\"\n\nAt the scene: Thomas Mackintosh, BBC London\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Forensic workers were seen at the custody centre on Friday\n\nMet Police officers have been standing outside the custody suite doing something they dread - mourning one of their own.\n\nSeveral bouquets of flowers have been placed outside the building in memory of the sergeant who was shot.\n\nResidents who live opposite have shared their shock and disbelief that such a tragic murder has happened so close to home.\n\nForensic teams have been spotted in the nearby yard gathering evidence, while other officers can be seen inside the suite carrying on with their duties.\n\n'Sick to their stomachs'\n\nKen Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation, said news of the shooting was \"utterly devastating\".\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Police officers leave flowers outside Croydon Custody Centre in south London\n\n\"Officers across London are in shock and sick to their stomachs at the nature of his death,\" he said.\n\n\"Sadly, on very rare occasions officers make the ultimate sacrifice whilst fulfilling their role. When that happens we will ensure their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten.\"", "date_added": "2020-09-25 15:46:11.807922+00:00", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54293111", "source": "BBC News", "photos_url": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/122E6/production/_114607447_mediaitem114607446.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=london::news.england.london.story.54293111.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:9f7c95b2-7704-4e18-95f3-7fce06e9ec2b]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.6.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_GNL]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/122E6/production/_114607447_mediaitem114607446.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p08sk11q.jpg"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
