The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately comment.", "date_added": "2020-09-20 13:24:18+00:00", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-wechat/u-s-judge-blocks-commerce-department-order-to-remove-wechat-from-app-stores-idUKKCN26B0J5?il=0", "source": "U.K.", "photos_url": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200920&t=2&i=1534195586&r=LYNXNPEG8J0E1&w=800"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
