However, easyJet has taken a prudent approach to capacity and the right actions on cash preservation.\n\n\"The airline continues to keep all liquidity options under review, but no decisions have been taken.\n\n\"Winter flying is always significantly lower than summer and easyJet will continue with its prudent and dynamic approach to capacity over the winter.\n\n\"No decisions have been taken and we will update the market in due course.\"\n\n30 PHOTOS Pictures of the week: September 20 - 26 See Gallery Pictures of the week: September 20 - 26 A piece of street art of two girls on Hawley Street.
