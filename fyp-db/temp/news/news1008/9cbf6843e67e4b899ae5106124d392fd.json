Many patients who have appeared to have recovered were found to also have inflammation of the heart.\n\nAs many as one in three COVID-19 patients may develop lingering symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CORONAVIRUS RIGHT NOW\n\nFAUCI SAYS NEW CORONAVIRUS ACTIONS BY FLORIDA GOVERNOR ARE ‘VERY CONCERNING’\n\nCOVID-19 TESTS THAT GIVE RESULTS IN MINUTES ARE GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT AROUND THE WORLD, WHO SAYS\n\nNEW MODEL PREDICTS ‘HUGE SURGE’ IN COVID-19 ACROSS US NEXT MONTH AS CASES RISE IN 21 STATES\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE MAY NOT APPROVE STRICTER FDA GUIDELINES FOR VACCINE APPROVAL\n\nDOGS THAT CAN DETECT CORONAVIRUS WITH NEARLY 100 PERCENT ACCURACY ARE BEING DEPLOYED AT A EUROPEAN AIRPORT", "date_added": "2020-09-29 12:33:21+00:00", "url": "https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/518751-90-percent-of-coronavirus-patients-experience-side", "source": "TheHill", "photos_url": ["https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/icon-mail-b.svg", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_pantone_92920.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_helsinkidogs_092320getty.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/icon-twitter-b.svg", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_elonmusk_123019getty_1.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/icon-twitter.svg", "https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/icon-facebook.svg", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_ustestguardianreport_050120getty_17.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10314615&c3=&c4=https%3A//thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/518751-90-percent-of-coronavirus-patients-experience-side&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gettyimages-biden-speaking-gaffe-stutter-2019.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/changingamerica.svg", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_defundmpd_092820getty.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/icon-instagram.svg", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_skstudyrecoveredpatients_092920getty.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_faucicoviddeaths_090120getty_3.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/icon-facebook-b.svg", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_olderwomanceo_22820istock.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_northdakota_092920getty.jpg?crop=175:236,smart&width=700", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_nflmasks_072220getty_0.jpg?crop=175:236,smart&width=700", "https://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/changingamerica/dist/images/thehill.png", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gettyimages-1219098603_1.jpg?crop=1:1,smart&width=360", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_maskmandatepoll_072220getty_2.jpg?crop=175:236,smart&width=700", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_skstudyrecoveredpatients_092920getty.jpg"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
