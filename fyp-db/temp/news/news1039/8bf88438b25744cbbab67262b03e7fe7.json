{"title": "New Caledonia holds independence poll as Pacific rivals vie for influence", "text": "The Pacific island of New Caledonia will hold its second vote on Sunday on whether to declare independence from France, amid fears that the territory of 271,000 is falling increasingly into China’s orbit.\n\nWhile domestically the referendum is focused on the question of self-determination and breaking free from colonial rule, the results will have long-term consequences for major powers in a region which has become a focus of geopolitical rivalry among the US, China and Australia.\n\nJosé Sousa-Santos, a senior associate in Pacific Regional Security at Victoria University of Wellington said there were serious concerns about the economic implications of leaving France, which provides the island with $1.5 billion a year in funding.\n\n“Without French budgetary support, New Caledonia will need to seek alternative partners. China is New Caledonia's largest trading partner. Beijing will be keeping a close eye on the referendum and will see an independent New Caledonia as an opportunity to increase its influence in the Pacific region,” he said.", "date_added": "2020-10-03 00:00:00+00:00", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/03/new-caledonia-holds-independence-poll-pacific-rivals-vie-influence/", "source": "The Telegraph", "photos_url": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/generic/Matt-cartoon-255x206px-small.png", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GJbO19qXlk8/mqdefault.jpg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000240871270_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpegimwidth=480", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000241072957_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4U72PvVlAMIniqBdHHa0YWILF6Q7LjvC6jVXbFLrevM.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000240944803_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql_tzPcsKQBkyUuy8aItKEdUIvfx6lPoez-YFK6IWJbE.jpegimwidth=480", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000241101184_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000240944803_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql_tzPcsKQBkyUuy8aItKEdUIvfx6lPoez-YFK6IWJbE.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/10/04/GettyImages-1002913898_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaoMNi4kgGP0fXgnKocWr3Lej_Ly0bOG-fW-nze31Bzs.jpg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000241025100_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwMJYxftKZExwjop9hyNEmWwlv1PvEFGKb3yU86xhZmk.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2020/08/10/TELEMMGLPICT000236750380_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbFoXn4d1uVNGRa1pDHVYNOxQQAzv8_GbhAJNOKndEE8.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Author%20photos/Matt%20Kilcoyne.png?impolicy=byline-author", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000240872247_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpegimwidth=480"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
