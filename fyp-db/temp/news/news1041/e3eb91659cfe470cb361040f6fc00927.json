In this time of trial, Canada will stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong,” Mendicino said.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne also slammed China for its decision, saying on Wednesday that Canada was “deeply disappointed that China has chosen to break its international obligations”.\n\nIn this time of trial, Canada will stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong Marco Mendicino, Canadian immigration minister\n\nThe comments came amid already strained ties between Canada and China.\n\nThe countries’ relationship has been tested since December 2018, when Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, an executive with Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, on an extradition requested by the United States.\n\nTwo Canadians – former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor – were arrested in China soon thereafter and accused of spying.\n\nChina has repeatedly accused Canada of meddling in its internal affairs after Canadian officials criticised Beijing’s human rights record in Hong Kong, as well as its treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority.\n\nSupporters hold a rally in solidarity with Hong Kong protesters, in Vancouver, Canada, in September 2019 [Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters] Last month, a Chinese government spokesman rejected a Canadian parliamentary committee report accusing Beijing of carrying out genocide against the Uighurs.\n\n“This is blatant interference in China’s internal affairs and reflects those Canadian individuals’ ignorance and prejudice,” Zhao Lijian said.", "date_added": "2020-11-12 00:00:00+00:00", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/12/canada-announces-pathway-residency-hong-kong-youth", "source": "", "photos_url": ["https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2019-09-29T000000Z_1873869040_RC145A4CC7B0_RTRMADP_3_HONGKONG-PROTESTS-CANADA.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C512", "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-12T200430Z_1511856551_RC2W1K9D6TBT_RTRMADP_3_HONGKONG-SECURITY-CANADA.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.aljazeera.com/static/media/footer-icon--white.9c8198f5.svg"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
