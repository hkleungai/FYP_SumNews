According to the statement, students gathering socially could have been the originator of the positive tests, and the district strongly encouraged all students and families to follow social distancing guidelines to prevent another suspension or the possible cancellation of extracurricular activities.\n\nSparta athletic director Steve Stoner confirmed that the Oct. 2 football game against Lakeland is cancelled and that any boys soccer, girls soccer, field hockey and girls tennis games before the return date are in the process of being rescheduled.\n\n“It was a district decision to nip it in the bud and try to get ahead of this,” Stoner said.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.
