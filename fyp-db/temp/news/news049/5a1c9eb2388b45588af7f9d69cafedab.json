{"title": "Eiffel Tower Briefly Evacuated After Bomb Threat", "text": "PARIS — The Eiffel Tower was briefly evacuated on Wednesday after the police in Paris received a phone call suggesting there was a bomb at the monument, but officers inspecting the site did not find anything suspicious.\n\nThe monument was “fully” evacuated shortly after midday as a precautionary measure after the police received the anonymous call, the company that runs the Eiffel Tower said in a statement. Police also cordoned off an area around the tower.\n\nThe site reopened two hours later after the police had carried out checks in and around the monument. The Paris police confirmed that officers did not find anything suspicious, but declined to provide more details about the anonymous call.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower, an icon of the French capital, is visited by millions every year. It was forced to close for months at the start of the coronavirus pandemic but gradually reopened over the summer.", "date_added": "2020-09-23 00:00:00+00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/world/europe/eiffel-tower.html", "source": "", "photos_url": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/world/aurelien-breeden/aurelien-breeden-thumbLarge-v2.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/23/world/23paris-topsub/merlin_177452043_ca756349-ba86-413d-b3cb-bef42400f07e-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/23/world/23paris-topsub/merlin_177452043_ca756349-ba86-413d-b3cb-bef42400f07e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
