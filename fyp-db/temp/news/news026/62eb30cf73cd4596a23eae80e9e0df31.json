{"title": "Banks' shares fall after fresh allegations of money laundering", "text": "Shares in HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered have fallen sharply after fresh allegations of money laundering.\n\nThe banking giants were named in reports claiming they, and other banks, allegedly enabled flows of dirty money around the world over a period of two decades, despite red flags about where the money was coming from.\n\nThe reports sent shares in HSBC falling 5 per cent in London to 288p, leaving them at half the price they were at the start of the year. In trading overnight in Hong Kong, the UK bank's shares slumped to their lowest in 25 years.\n\nBarclays shares dropped 6.4 per cent to 91p in early trading, while Standard Chartered fell 4.8 per cent to 342p.\n\nUnder pressure: HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered are among the global banks accused of enabling flows of dirty money around the world\n\nThe latest allegations are based on thousands of documents showing more than $2trillion (£1.55trillion) of suspicious transactions between 1999 and 2017 by banks including JPMorgan, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Bank of New York Mellon and others.\n\nMore than 2,100 'suspicious activity reports', or SARs, filed by banks with the US anti-money laundering authorities were leaked to Buzzfeed News and shared with an international group of investigative journalists and media outlets around the world.\n\nBanks use SARs to report suspicious behaviour by a client, but they are not proof of wrongdoing, and banks can continue to do business with these clients.\n\nStandard Chartered flagged some $166billion in suspicious reports, Barclays $21billion and HSBC $4.4billion, according to the reports.\n\nIt is not the first time HSBC is accused of money laundering. The tainted bank was fined £1.2billion in 2012 for handling dirty cash from drug lords, but then escaped criminal proceedings.\n\nThe bank said that as of 2012 it had embarked on a 'multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime.' However, some of the suspicious transactions referenced by the reports appear to have taken place post the Mexican fiasco.\n\nHSBC, which makes most of its profit in Asia, is also facing other pressures, including political tension in Hong Kong and and fears it could be added to a Chinese list of firms deemed a threat to national security.\n\nThe Global Times, a newspaper controlled by the Chinese government, reported the bank could be one of the first firms to be named on Beijing's 'unreliable entity list' as part of a tit-for-tat stand-off with several western countries.\n\nFiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index, says: 'The so-called unreliable entity list looks to punish firms that damage national security.\n\n'Should HSBC find itself on the list the bank will experiencing problems expanding into mainland China after investing heavily in directing the business that way over the past few years.'\n\nIn trading overnight in Hong Kong, HSBC shares slumped to their lowest in 25 years\n\nMeanwhile, StanChart, which also makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, said in a statement it took its 'responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously and have invested substantially in our compliance programmes'.\n\nBarclays said it believes it has complied with 'all its legal and regulatory obligations, including in relation to U.S. sanctions.'\n\nCincotta added: 'Whilst it has been a while since the last banking sector scandal, it hasn't been long enough. This is a sector which constantly appears to struggle to stay on the right side of regulators and the law.'\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com, said: 'Whilst it is unclear to extent there will be a material impact on the banks in question, and whether the transactions are covered by existing DoJ deals and fines, it raises litigation and regulatory risk and we cannot rule out fines and charges being levied by various actors.'\n\nThe reports come at a tricky time for banks like HSBC, which have been facing headwinds because of the coronavirus pandemic, including the risk of a large jump in customer bad debts and the prospect of low interest rates for a long time.", "date_added": "2020-09-21 11:37:59+01:00", "url":
