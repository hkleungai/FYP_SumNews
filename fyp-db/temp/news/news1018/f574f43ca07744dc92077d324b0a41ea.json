They shouldn't be moving the goalposts and changing the rules in the middle of the game.\"\n\nMr Biden called the debate \"a national embarrassment.\"\n\nThe deputy manager of his campaign, Kate Bedingfield, said the former vice-president will \"be focused on answering questions from the voters there, under whatever set of rules the Commission develops to try to contain Donald Trump's behaviour\".\n\nWhat happened at the first debate?\n\nWednesday's debate saw constant interruptions from Mr Trump which led to bickering, with both candidates talking over each other.\n\nMr Trump questioned Mr Biden's intelligence, saying: \"There's nothing smart about you Joe. 47 years, you've done nothing,\"\n\nHe later bought up Mr Biden's son Hunter, raising questions about his links with Ukraine as well as mentioning his drug problems.\n\nThe pair also clashed about Mr Biden's now deceased son Beau and his military service.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Biden called Mr Trump \"the worst president this country has ever had\", dubbed him a \"clown\", and at one point asked, \"Will you shut up, man?\"\n\n:: Subscribe to Divided States on Apple podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and Spreaker\n\nWhat about the next ones?\n\nBoth campaigns have said they expect to attend future debates, with the next one scheduled for 15 October in Miami.\n\nThe second debate will be in a town hall format, meaning half the questions to both candidates will come from voters in the hall while the other half will be influenced by voter concerns on social media.\n\nThe last debate is on 22 October - less than two weeks before the election on 3 November.", "date_added": "2020-10-01 14:10:49.502217+00:00", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/us-election-2020-debate-rules-to-change-after-chaotic-trump-biden-exchange-12086573", "source": "Sky News", "photos_url": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035677&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://e3.365dm.com/20/09/1600x900/skynews-biden-trump_5113345.jpg?20200930034248", "https://e3.365dm.com/20/09/768x432/skynews-trump-biden_5113334.jpg?20200930025044 600w", "https://news.sky.com/resources/sky-news-logo.png?v=1?bypass-service-worker", "https://news.sky.com/resources/sky-spectrum-logo.png", "https://e3.365dm.com/20/09/768x432/skynews-biden-trump-composite_5113328.jpg?20200930024129 600w"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
