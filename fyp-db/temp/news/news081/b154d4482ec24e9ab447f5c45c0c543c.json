At present it is owned by a Chinese company, Bytedance, but operated as a separate entity to Douyin - a parallel version used by Chinese consumers.\n\nThe Trump administration has claimed Bytedance's involvement poses a unacceptable national security threat, because it would have to comply with an order to support the CCP's \"malicious collection of American citizens' personal data\".\n\nBytedance denies this, saying that TikTok's user data is kept in the US and Singapore, and so is not subject to Chinese law\n\nBut President Trump subsequently said he would not accept any arrangement that did not involve Bytedance ceding control to the two US firms.\n\nTikTok's statement on Monday suggested negotiations over the deal were still ongoing.\n\n\"We will also maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the President gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement,\" it said.\n\nimage caption TikTok's audience skews younger than that of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter\n\nTo further complicate matters, Beijing has yet to announce whether it will grant Bytedance a licence to include TikTok's algorithms in any deal.\n\nAlgorithms power the app's recommendation engine, deciding which videos to show to each user, based on the ways they have previously interacted with the product.\n\nThe algorithms are highly responsive to each person's interests, quickly picking up on shifts in behaviour, and are credited with helping make the app so popular.\n\nIf China refused to let them be included in a deal, it could scupper any sell-off.\n\nA 'stay of execution' for a social media phenomenon\n\nTikTok really has morphed into a platform that rivals Instagram and Facebook in America.\n\nFor the US to ban the app would be simply unprecedented. And for now, it's been given a stay of execution.\n\nThe court will now take its time, as it looks into whether it's a threat to national security.\n\nOne thing that was striking in the open evidence presented though was that there was no smoking gun.\n\nThere were lots of assertions, for example that TikTok's owner Bytedance was a \"mouthpiece\" for the Chinese government, but no killer punch.\n\nWhat this delay does is buy TikTok much needed time. They need to do three things.\n\nWrap up a deal with Oracle and Walmart, get Trump to support it and then get the Chinese government to approve it.\n\nAnd all whilst the clock runs down. This TikTok saga isn't even close to being done.\n\n'Critical growth'\n\nTikTok has said it has more than 100 million active users in the US and about 700 million worldwide.\n\nIt has claimed even a temporary ban would threaten its business.\n\n\"[A] ban will cause our user base to stagnate and then precipitously decline,\" wrote interim boss Vanessa Pappas in a court filing\n\n\"For TikTok to remain competitive, continued growth at this stage in our development is critical.\"\n\nThe US government has issued two executive orders targeting TikTok. While the first is designed to prevent it being distributed via Apple and Google, the second is more far-reaching.\n\nDue to come into force on 12 November , it is designed to shut the app down outright in the US, if the president's national security concerns are not resolved.\n\nTikTok Timeline\n\nimage copyright EPA\n\nMarch 2012: Bytedance is established in China and launches Neihan Duanzi - an app to help Chinese users share memes\n\nSeptember 2016: Bytedance launches the short-form video app Douyin in China\n\nAugust 2017: An international version of Douyin is launched under the brand TikTok in some parts of the world, but not the US at this time\n\nNovember 2017: Bytedance buys lip-synch music app Musical.ly\n\nMay 2018: TikTok declared world's most downloaded non-game iOS app over first three months of the year, by market research firm Sensor Tower\n\nAugust 2018: Bytedance announces it is shutting down Musical.ly and is moving users over to TikTok\n\nFebruary 2019: TikTok fined in US over Musical.ly's handling of under-13s' data\n\nOctober 2019: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg publicly criticises TikTok, accusing it of censoring protests\n\nNovember 2019: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States opens a national security investigation into TikTok\n\nMay 2020: TikTok hires Disney executive Kevin Meyer to become the division's chief executive and chief operating officer of Bytedance\n\nJune 2020: India bans TikTok among dozens of other Chinese apps\n\nJuly 2020: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and then President Trump, say TikTok might be banned\n\nAugust 2020: Microsoft and Oracle make rival approaches to acquire or otherwise operate TikTok in the US and three other markets.
