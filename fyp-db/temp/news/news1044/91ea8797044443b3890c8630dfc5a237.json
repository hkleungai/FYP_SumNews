With communications cut and media barred, there has been no independent confirmation of the state of the fighting.\n\nThe TPLF says Abiy's government has systematically persecuted Tigrayans since he took office in April 2018 and terms the military operations an \"invasion\".\n\nFederal troops have been carrying out air strikes and there has been fighting on the ground since Wednesday of last week. Ethiopia denied a TPLF claim that federal jets had knocked out a power dam.\n\nAbiy this week urged Ethiopians to ensure Tigrayans are not targeted. \"We all must be our brother’s keeper by protecting Tigrayans from any negative pressures,\" he said.\n\nBut more than 14,500 Ethiopian refugees - half of them children - have gone to Sudan since fighting started and aid agencies say the situation in Tigray is becoming dire. There are also concerns about a mass displacement of thousands of Eritrean refugees at a camp in Ethiopia.", "date_added": "2020-11-13 13:34:00+00:00", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/war-crimes-feared-ethiopia-s-tigray-conflict-thousands-flee-neighboring-n1247664", "source": "NBC News", "photos_url": ["https://media13.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202011/ethiograb.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_46/3428111/201113-ethiopia-fighting-mn-0810_af957ec2c40645552acafdf586489d6b.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
