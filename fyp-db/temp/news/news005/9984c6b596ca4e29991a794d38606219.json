{"title": "Tom Hardy ‘cast as NEW James Bond’ to replace Daniel Craig after No Time To Die", "text": "He’s been one of the bookies’ favourites to be the next James Bond for the last few years. And now a respected scooper has reported that Tom Hardy has indeed been cast as the next 007 to replace Daniel Craig after No Time To Die . However, this is not an official confirmation and so such a claim should be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\nThe Vulcan Reporter claims they heard back in June that Hardy had basically been locked into the role after a successful audition.\n\nReportedly, the 43-year-old was expected to be announced as the new Bond in November, but this now seems unlikely due to the on-going coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNevertheless, the outlet anticipates that an announcement will come before the end of 2020. While they also admitted that 2021 seems likely, especially if No Time To Die is delayed again.\n\nIncredibly, there have already been major reports dating back to 2017 that Tom Hardy was signed on and ready to step in if Daniel Craig didn't return for fifth movie.\n\nREAD MORE: James Bond 'Tom Hardy cast as next 007': UK bookies have IMMEDIATELY suspended all bets", "date_added": "2020-09-19 00:00:00+01:00", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/1337457/Tom-Hardy-new-James-Bond-Daniel-Craig-No-Time-To-Die-Christopher-Nolan-next-James-Bond", "source": "Express.co.uk", "photos_url": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/35/285x190/1336982_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/285x190/1336888_1.jpg", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/750x445/1337457.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/285x190/1337545_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/static/share/comment.png", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/285x190/942799_1.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/static/share/pinterest.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2020-09-19.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/285x190/831313_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/static/share/facebook.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/static/share/copylink.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/static/share/linkedin.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/static/share/twitter.png"], "is_grouped": false, "upvotes": 0, "downvotes": 0}
